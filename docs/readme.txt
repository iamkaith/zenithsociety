## DETAILS
1. please "npm install"
2. You can use "ng serve" on port 4200 for the dev environment I was using OR  use "npm start" on port 3000 and it will build and compile (it might take a while ) 
    - Weirdly my datepicker and timepicker don't work in my build version, they only work in my dev version
    - That's weird right? I thought when you build and compile it will package any dependencies together
3. use Chrome as your browser

## COMPLETE
- Angular is used on the front end
- Express/node on the backend 
- Main page shows a list of current events 
- Other button is for "admin" I called it the admin dashboard


## NOT COMPLETE
- Not fully implementing API and mLab -- project is still using a static file because I was unable to stitch together maybe I misunderstood how it works. 
- Deploy to Heroku -- same thing that happened in my Flintstones lab, I kept getting that weird build error but I wasn't sure why
- no EJS view? I wasn't sure how to route to EJS when I had the front end part written in Angular and the routing module was inside there

## PARTIAL COMPLETION
- REST API & mLab partially complete but not fully implemented -- I kept going even if I didn't fully implement, I wanted to show I understood what it should do even if I couldn't pull it all together properly.
    - you will find in my EventService class there are CRUD operations
    - in routes/events.js you will find the API REST points as I understand them and those interact with the Mongoose module I used to connect to mLab



## MAJOR CHALLENGES
First time pulling a lot of technologies together, it was really challenging for me because I'm still new to web development (only has been < 1 year learning languages for web). I only used these technologies at BCIT and they were all taught in small little chunks across a few classes (Angular, Node + a little bit of Mongo, HTML, MVC structure, JSON) so I felt really lost when I started. I went through 2 iterations of this product spending a lot of hours only to realize I was doing it wrong. This is my 3rd "project" folder and it still isn't complete so I was a frustrated.But I know I will get when I practice more and more since I'm still new. 

I felt like I knew what I needed to do but all my knowledge was in separate chunks and while I could do them separately, it was piecing everything together that was incredibly difficult for me. And I don't know if this happens to you but you know how you start coding and you're doing one section but then you think of something like "oh I should do this for something else" or "oh no I forgot to do x" and then you go to fix it but then you forget what you were originally doing -- that happened a lot. 

This is probably one of the hardest assignments I have had up to date, very humbling, very imtimidating but I feel like it was one I can walk away from knowing I learnt a lot more then when I started so thank you Medhat. Even though it isn't totally complete I still learnt a lot, I'm not convinced this is my best work (because it isn't) but I think it was still good for my ability right now! 

## EXTRA THOUGHTS OR THINGS I WOULD DO BETTER
- I think... I did the schema wrong so I would change that for sure
- I will likely change bits of this and publish on my Github and during semester break/next semester. I would like to improve this and deploy it properly.
